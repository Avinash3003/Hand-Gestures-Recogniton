# Hand-Gestures-Recogniton

This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures using 21 key landmarks of the hand. A custom dataset of hand gestures was created by capturing the coordinates of 
these landmarks. Each gesture is labeled and mapped to specific hand movements or positions. The model is trained using this dataset to predict various gestures 
based on the relative positions of the landmarks. Machine learning algorithms are applied to classify the gestures, enabling real-time hand gesture recognition. This
project highlights key steps such as data collection, feature extraction, model training, and gesture prediction.
